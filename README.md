# CryptGuardian – Advanced Blockchain Security Module

**Version:** 0.2-alpha
**Copyright:** 2025 NemesisCyberForce

---

## Overview

CryptGuardian is a single-file, advanced blockchain security module designed to **detect, analyze, and mitigate threats in real time**.
It integrates **threat intelligence, pattern-based analysis, timing detection, and deep security alerts**, making it a robust tool for monitoring blockchain data integrity.

This module is **thread-safe** and built to test and block suspicious or malicious patterns automatically.

## What’s New

### Advanced Threat Intelligence

* Detects SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection, and Buffer Overflow patterns
* Regex-based pattern analysis
* Similarity-checking to catch replay attacks

### Timing Attack Detection

* Analyzes block timing patterns
* Detects DDoS burst patterns
* Sliding-window statistical analysis

### Enhanced Alert System

* Threat-specific mitigation suggestions
* Risk scoring with prioritization
* Color-coded alerts with detailed context

### Deep Security Analysis

* Multi-layer block validation
* Consensus validator support
* Comprehensive security reports

---

## Features

* **Automatic threat detection:** Recognizes and blocks common attack vectors
* **Replay attack detection:** Identifies duplicate or highly similar transactions
* **Timing anomaly detection:** Flags unusual block intervals and bursts
* **Quarantine system:** Suspicious blocks can be isolated
* **Advanced alerting:** Alerts provide risk scores and actionable mitigation steps
* **Thread-safe architecture:** Safe for multi-threaded environments
* **Full blockchain reporting:** Statistics on blocks, quarantined entries, and validators

---

## Demo & Testing

The module includes test scenarios that automatically simulate attack patterns:

* SQL Injections → detected and blocked
* XSS attempts → trigger alerts
* Buffer Overflow patterns → flagged
* Replay attacks (duplicate blocks) → intercepted
* Timing anomalies → logged and reported

To run the demo:

```bash
python cryptguardian.py
```

---

## Roadmap

* ML-based anomaly detection
* Advanced consensus mechanisms
* Integration with external threat intelligence sources
* Optional API/web dashboard for monitoring

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptguardian.git
cd cryptguardian
pip install -r requirements.txt  # minimal dependencies: requests, numpy
```

---

## Usage Example

```python
from cryptguardian import SmartBlockchain, enhanced_alert_handler

# Initialize blockchain
blockchain = SmartBlockchain()
blockchain.guardian.register_alert_handler(enhanced_alert_handler)
blockchain.guardian.register_validator("validator_001")

# Add blocks
blockchain.add_block("Normal transaction")
blockchain.add_block("SELECT * FROM users; DROP TABLE users;--")  # SQL Injection
```

---

## Security Report

```python
report = blockchain.get_security_report()
print(report)
```

Includes:

* Chain length and validity
* Number of quarantined blocks
* Threat patterns detected
* Registered validators
* Basic statistics
