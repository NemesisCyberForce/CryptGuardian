# CryptGuardian – ChainGuardian Module

**Version:** 0.1-alpha
**Copyright:** 2025 Volkan Sah

---

## Overview

CryptGuardian is an experimental security module designed to monitor blockchain structures in real time.
At its core, the **ChainGuardian** acts as a watchdog that:

* Validates block integrity
* Performs pattern-based analysis (e.g., timing and data similarity)
* Includes a simple ML-based anomaly detection component
* Warns or quarantines suspicious blocks

The goal is to not only store blocks but also **detect unusual or malicious activity within the chain as it happens**.

---

## Features

* Block integrity validation (hash and timestamp)
* Pattern-based analysis (timing, data similarity)
* Basic ML-driven anomaly detection (currently using random scores as placeholder)
* Quarantine system for suspicious blocks
* Alert system with custom handlers (logging, email, Slack, etc.)
* SmartBlockchain wrapper with integrated guardian logic

## Project Structure

```
cryptguardian/
├── chain_guardian.py      # Core: ChainGuardian & ChainPattern
├── smart_blockchain.py    # Extended blockchain class with guardian integration
├── example_usage.py       # Example usage with alerts
```

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NemesisCyberForce/CryptGuardian/cryptguardian.git
cd cryptguardian

```

Dependencies: Python standard libraries and **numpy**.

---

## Quick Start Example

```python
from smart_blockchain import SmartBlockchain, SecurityException

blockchain = SmartBlockchain()

# Optional: register a custom alert handler
def alert_handler(alert):
    print(f"[{alert['severity']}] {alert['message']}")

blockchain.guardian.register_alert_handler(alert_handler)

try:
    blockchain.add_block("Normal transaction #1")
    blockchain.add_block("Suspicious transaction with unusual pattern")
except SecurityException as e:
    print(f"Security violation detected: {e}")
```

---

## Roadmap

* [x] Pattern detection (timing and data similarity)
* [x] Alert system and quarantine functionality
* [ ] Replace random-based ML detection with a proper model
* [ ] Extend the pattern library (e.g., frequency analysis, network anomalies)
* [ ] Optional blockchain visualization tools
