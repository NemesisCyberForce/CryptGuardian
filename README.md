## Overview

CryptGuardian is a **zero-dependency**, advanced blockchain security module designed to **detect, analyze, and mitigate threats in real-time**. It integrates threat intelligence, pattern-based analysis, timing detection, and deep security alerts, making it a robust tool for monitoring blockchain data integrity.

This module is **thread-safe**, **production-ready**, and built to automatically test and block suspicious or malicious patterns without external dependencies.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NemesisCyberForce/CryptGuardian.git
cd CryptGuardian
python cryptguardian_enhanced.py  # No pip install needed!
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from cryptguardian_enhanced import SmartBlockchain, enhanced_alert_handler

# Initialize blockchain with advanced security
blockchain = SmartBlockchain()
blockchain.guardian.register_alert_handler(enhanced_alert_handler)
blockchain.guardian.register_validator("validator_001")

# Test various transaction scenarios
blockchain.add_block("Normal transaction #1")
blockchain.add_block("SELECT * FROM users; DROP TABLE users;--")  # Blocked!

# Generate comprehensive security report
report = blockchain.get_security_report()
print(f"Security Status: {report}")
```

## Demo & Attack Simulation

The module includes **8 automated test scenarios** that simulate real-world attack patterns:

**Detected Attack Vectors:**
- SQL Injection attempts ‚Üí **BLOCKED** with CRITICAL alerts
- XSS payloads ‚Üí **FLAGGED** with HIGH severity  
- Command injection ‚Üí **DETECTED** with mitigation suggestions
- Buffer overflow patterns ‚Üí **IDENTIFIED** and quarantined
- Replay attacks ‚Üí **INTERCEPTED** via similarity analysis
- Timing anomalies ‚Üí **LOGGED** with statistical analysis
- DDoS burst patterns ‚Üí **MONITORED** with rate limiting suggestions

**Run comprehensive security testing:**
```bash
python cryptguardian_enhanced.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Threat Patterns
```python
# Add custom threat signatures
guardian.threat_intel.known_threats['custom_malware'] = [
    r'eval\s*\(',
    r'base64_decode',
    r'shell_exec'
]
```

### Alert Handler Customization  
```python
def custom_alert_handler(alert):
    # Send to SIEM, database, webhook, etc.
    if alert.severity == AlertSeverity.CRITICAL:
        send_to_security_team(alert)
        
blockchain.guardian.register_alert_handler(custom_alert_handler)
```

### Security Report Analysis
```python
report = blockchain.get_security_report()
print(f"""
Chain Security Status:
- Total Blocks: {report['chain_length']}
- Chain Valid: {report['chain_valid']}
- Threats Blocked: {report['statistics']['threats_detected']}  
- Quarantined: {report['statistics']['blocks_quarantined']}
- Validators: {report['validators_registered']}
""")
```
